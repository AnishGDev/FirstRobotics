# Command-Based
Slightly more complicated
Split into subsystems and commands. 

Read documentations for how this is implemented.

Ingenious idea of a Command-Base borrowed from other teams where all commands can inherit references to every subsystem on the robot. 


To use this:
1) Create an empty WPLIB project with a command-based template.
2) Replace your main folder in src, with the above contents
3) Build and deploy.
